# Horizon Hoppers ✈️

This is the final project for one of the course in the curriculum of the _IBM JavaScript Back-end Developer_.

### What is the project about?

This is a website for a **Travel Recommendation Company** called ***Horizon Hoppers*** where users can:

- Search for different recommended destinations through the "Search Engine" integrated withing the website

- Know about the company

- Contact the company directly through "Contact Us" page

### Challenges in this project

- **Simple "Search Engine"**: Even though it's a pretty simple "Search Engine". It's the first time that I had to reason about how the search from the user would be filtered and how the input would be processed through the mock DB given.

- **Pure Vanilla JavaScript**: I include this not because it was actually VERY difficult, but it was a great practice to create different DOM nodes more manually by only being able to use Vanilla JavaScript.
